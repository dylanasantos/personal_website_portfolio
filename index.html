                    <p>
                        Since I started writing my first lines of code at 13, computer science quickly became a major passion of mine. Over the years, I’ve spent countless hours learning fundamentals, exploring numerous languages, and developing deeper computational logic by building small projects and experimenting with different areas of programming, 
                        which ultimately shaped my interest in the field. Currently, I attend Coastal Carolina University as an undergraduate freshman and am very open to opportunities from anywhere. Right now, I’m focusing on understanding not only how programming languages function, but also on developing a stronger grasp of software engineering concepts and how they apply in real-world situations.
                        Looking ahead, I plan to become proficient in several programming languages and pursue graduate school with a focus on quantum computing, aiming to become a quantum software engineer.

                        Coastal Carolina's C.I.P.H.E.R. club (Computing Innovation Programming Hardware Engineering Research) is the official Computer Science student-based organization
                        for Coastal Carolina University. C.I.P.H.E.R. covers all aspects of Computer Science. From Raspberry Pi technical demonstrations, to creating video games, C.I.P.H.E.R. 
                        not only has an interactive community, but also a very educational, and supportive one for any and all people with an interest in the C.S. feild.

                    <p>
                        As a Self-Employed Volunteer Programming Tutor, I provide individualized academic support to peers through virtual sessions, 
                        and teach the foundational programming, and software engineering concepts/strategies in a clear and engaging manner. I deliver personalized lesson plans based on each student’s skill level, 
                        covering topics such as basic coding logic, debugging techniques, and computational thinking. I may also guide students through practice exercises, projects, and real-time troubleshooting to reinforce understanding and build confidence. 
                        I also educate students on various complex technical concepts in simple terms/analogies, monitor their progress, and adapt lectures to meet the unique and diverse learning needs of each person.

                    <p>
                        My primary and most developed programming language. I have strong intermediate‑level proficiency and use C++ as the foundation for most of my projects. 
                        Many of my long‑term plans are designed with C++ in mind or eventually translated into it due to its performance, control, and versatility.
